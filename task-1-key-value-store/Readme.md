# Task 1: JSON key value store

This is the first program I have written in order to learn Go.

This is a simple little program used to read/write keys to a json file.

Absolutely zero though went into performance, it was about working with
files and processing JSON.

In order to run this program you can run `go run .`

You will then be prompted to provide the path to a JSON file.

Once provided you can then use the following commands:

```
set {key} {value}
get {key}
```
